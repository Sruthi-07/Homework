    "### Analysis 1: Body Image Satisfaction vs. Mental Health Scores\n",
    "Variables to Explore:\n",
    "- Body Image Satisfaction (self-perception of weight, physical appearance, or height)\n",
    "- Mental Health Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan: Conduct a correlation analysis to explore the relationship between body image satisfaction and mental health scores. Additionally, consider using regression analysis to determine if body image satisfaction can significantly predict mental health outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Results: A potential finding could be a negative correlation, indicating that lower body image satisfaction is associated with poorer mental health outcomes (higher anxiety, stress, or lower general well-being). Itâ€™s also possible that the data shows no significant relationship, which could suggest that body image satisfaction does not directly impact mental health within this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: This analysis can help highlight if body image issues are a significant predictor of mental health problems among students, which could be useful for developing targeted mental health resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis 2: Age vs. Body Image Satisfaction \n",
    "Variables to Explore: \n",
    "- Age of participants.\n",
    "- Body Image Satisfaction (scores related to body self-image).\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan: Use a scatter plot or ANOVA to explore any trends in body image satisfaction across different age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Results: You might see that younger students have lower satisfaction compared to older students, or find no significant age-related differences. If age correlates with body satisfaction, it could imply that self-image concerns shift over time, which could be important for mental health resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Identifying any age-based trends in body satisfaction may help in tailoring counseling or self-image workshops to specific age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis 3: Province of Residence and LGBTQ+ Identity\n",
    "Variables to Explore: \n",
    "- Province of residence.\n",
    "- LGBTQ+ identity (variables that describe orientation or gender identity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan: Use a chi-square test or a bar chart to observe if LGBTQ+ identity proportions vary significantly across provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Results: A variance might suggest some regions have a higher self-identification rate in the LGBTQ+ community, possibly related to social or cultural factors.This would indicate potential areas where targeted support might be beneficial based on regional demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: This could help identify provinces where more inclusive policies or community groups could enhance student well-being and a sense of belonging."
